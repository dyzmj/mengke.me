## Motivation

> Sharing is learning!

I created this blog to record and share my learnings and insights as a software engineer, but also to keep track of my life. It is a treasure trove of valuable information that I have accumulated throughout my journey.

Recording and organizing my thoughts helps me solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies. My goal is to provide a useful resource for those interested in web development and related technologies.

Your comments and feedback are highly appreciated üçª. They contribute to the growth and improvement of this blog.

## How to deploy a similar blog?

### 2. Modify data

1. Rename the `.env.example` file in the root directory to `.env` and modify the value in it.

2. Update the information in the files in the `/data` directory, which contains the blog data.

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

1. Sign up and log in to Vercel, and connect your GitHub account.

2. Create a new project and import your blog repository directly.

3. In the project settings, select **Environment Variables** and add the variables in `.env` (for safety, do not push the `.env` file to GitHub).

4. Vercel will automatically deploy every time a commit is pushed to the `main` branch.

### 4. Blog post visits can also be stored in Vercel for free

1. Create a `Postgres Database` in Vercel.

2. You will get a string similar to: `postgres://default:xxxxx@xx-xx-xx-xxxx.us-xx-x.postgres.vercel-storage.com:xxx/verceldb`, add it to the `DATABASE_URL` variable in the `.env` file.

3. The number of views of each blog post will be automatically counted in this database.
